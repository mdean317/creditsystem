NOTE: In the final time of the assignment, I started to get errors when starting the container. 
While I can continue debug them, I'm afraid I've already exceeded the time restictions of the assignment. 
For that reason, the instructions may not work. 


1. Run docker on your computer
2. navigate to target folder and git clone https://github.com/mdean317/creditsystem.git
3. cd creditsystem 
4. touch .env
5. Fill in in .env:
    DB_USER ={your db user}  
    DB_PASSWORD ={your db password}
    DATABASE_URL='postgres://{your db user}:{your db password}@db:5432/credit_system'
6. docker-compose build --no-cache
7. docker-compose up
